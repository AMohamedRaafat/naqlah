## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Configuration (next.config.mjs)

```diff
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
const nextConfig = {
- swcMinify: true,  // ❌ Deprecated in Next.js 15
  headers: async () => [
    {
      source: '/sw.js',
      headers: [
-       // Missing Content-Type header
      ],
    },
  ],
};

// AFTER (WORKING)
const nextConfig = {
+ // swcMinify removed (enabled by default)
  headers: async () => [
    {
      source: '/sw.js',
      headers: [
+       { key: 'Content-Type', value: 'application/javascript' },
+       { key: 'Cache-Control', value: 'public, max-age=0, must-revalidate' },
+       { key: 'Service-Worker-Allowed', value: '/' },
      ],
    },
+   {
+     source: '/manifest.json',
+     headers: [

  ],
};
```

### Middleware

```javascript
// BEFORE: ❌ MISSING FILE

// AFTER: ✅ CREATED
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const pathname = request.nextUrl.pathname;

  // Allow PWA files to pass through
  if (pathname === '/sw.js' || pathname === '/manifest.json') {
    return NextResponse.next();
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|assets|sw.js|manifest.json).*)'],
};
```

### next-intl Plugin

```javascript
// BEFORE
- const withNextIntl = createNextIntlPlugin();

// AFTER
